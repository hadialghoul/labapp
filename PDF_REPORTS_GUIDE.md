### **React Native Integration**
```javascript
// Fetch patient reports data
const response = await fetchWithAuth(`${BASE_URL}/accounts/reports/patients/`);
const data = await response.json();

// Download specific report
const downloadReport = async (patient) => {
  const reportUrl = `${BASE_URL}${patient.report_url}`;
  const response = await fetchWithAuth(reportUrl);
  // Handle PDF response
};
```

### **Admin Integration**
```python
class PatientAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('user', 'phone', 'doctor', 'get_report_link')
    
    def get_report_link(self, obj):
        url = f"/admin/accounts/patient/{obj.id}/report/"
